🚀 Strassen Algorithm - Full Stack Matrix Multiplication
This project is a full-stack implementation of matrix multiplication using both Traditional and Strassen’s Algorithm. Users can input the number of rows and columns, and the app will compute the multiplication and display the time taken by each algorithm for comparison.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js (Express)
Extra C++ implementation (inside the server file)

💡 Features

1. Input matrix dimensions (n x n)
2. Perform multiplication using:
3. Traditional method
4. Strassen Algorithm

Show computation time for both methods

📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to client and run:
<code>npm install && npm start</code>
3. Navigate to server and run:
<code>npm install && node index.js</code>

If you just want to test algo in compiler you can text cpp file by just copying the code from this repo.
**Note: C++ environment is set up to compile and run strassen.cpp**
