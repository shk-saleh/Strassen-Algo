🚀 Strassen Algorithm - Full Stack Matrix Multiplication
This project is a full-stack implementation of matrix multiplication using both Traditional and Strassen’s Algorithm. Users can input the number of rows and columns, and the app will compute the multiplication and display the time taken by each algorithm for comparison.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js (Express)
Extra C++ implementation (inside the server file)

💡 Features

1. Input matrix dimensions (n x n)
2. Perform multiplication using:
3. Traditional method
4. Strassen Algorithm
5. 
Show computation time for both methods

📌 How to Run
